// type assertions: This is used when you know exactly the type of data you expect
// a given variable to be. In outer languages like C++ it's called type casting.
// only to be used when you are very sure the type of data type a given 
// variable will be. This is what we call type assertions. 
// Type assertions can be implemented in two main ways:
// 1. as syntax
// 2. angle brackets syntax
